I swallow hard and start moving toward the bags.,我使劲咽了口唾沫，朝袋子走去。,48,15
"They're the size of my head, and it seems impossible that all of that could be gold.",它们和我的头一样大小，应该不可能全是金子。,84,21
"I let out a short little laugh that just comes out of me, because I still can't believe any of this.",我发出的笑声短暂而轻微，因为我仍然无法相信所有这些。,100,26
At least not until I see it.,至少在我看到之前不会。,28,11
"So, I crouch down in front of one of the bags, grabbing the drooping opening which I lift up and spread open to peer inside.",于是，我蹲在其中一个袋子前，提起下垂的开口，摊开，仔细端详着里面。,124,33
...rocks.,...石头。,9,6
"I squint at them, wondering if maybe the gold is stuck inside of them, or something.",我眯起眼睛，想知道金子是不是埋在下面，还是怎么样。,84,25
"That would explain the ridiculous amount, but I don't see anything glinting.",这可以解释这个荒唐的数量，不过我看不到有任何的闪光。,76,26
I start to ask Jack to bring the lantern closer.,我想让Jack把灯拿近一些。,48,14
An explosion goes off in my head.,爆裂声在我的脑中响起。,33,11
"It shakes my entire body, my entire world.",它撼动了我的整个身体，我的整个世界。,42,18
"Everything stops, and I can't think.",一切都停止了，我无法思考。,36,13
"Actually, I am conscious of one thing, and it's my teeth clacking together like someone just punched me in the chin.",事实上，我只对一件事有知觉，就是我的牙齿咔嚓咔嚓地碰撞在一起，就像有人一拳打中了我的下巴。,116,45
But it's not coming from the front of my head...it's the back.,但这不是从头的前面传来的...是后面。,62,19
"Then the world comes back to me, and I realize I'm still crouching over the bag somehow, but my shoulders are all bunched up, my head leaned back like the muscles in my neck are cramping.",接着，世界又回到了我的身边。我意识到自己还在那个袋子上蹲伏着，但是肩膀全都挤在了一起。我的头向后仰去，就像脖子上的肌肉在抽筋那样。,187,65
"I gasp really loud, like I'm drowning, and I slowly bring my paws up to where that explosion happened.",我仿佛要被淹死一样，非常大声地喘着气，然后迟缓地把爪子挪到爆裂发生的地方。,102,37
"They go automatically to the back of my head, between where my neck and skull meet.",它们无意识地来到了我的后脑勺，脖子与头骨相接的地方。,83,26
"I just sit there for a second, confused as all hell, wondering if something fell from the ceiling as I go on staring at the bag.",我只是坐在那里，糊涂得要命，不知道是否在我盯着包看的时候，有什么从上面掉了下来。,128,40
"Then another explosion, a little higher so that it hits my head and my paws.",然后又是一声爆裂，这次的位置高一些，击中了我的头和爪子。,76,28
"This time, I feel my body go all stiff in the strangest way, my legs straightening out which pushes me away from the bag and onto my back, then I see my arms sticking up, paws reaching toward the ceiling...",这一次，我感觉整个身体以一种奇怪的方式僵硬了起来。我抻直的腿将我推离了袋子，往后面倒去。之后，我看到我的手臂杵在半空，爪子伸向洞顶...,206,68
...,...,3,3
...,...,3,3
...,...,3,3
"I blink at the sky above me in confusion, wondering why it's so yellow and dirty...",我疑惑地眨着眼，望向头顶的天空，不知道它为什么这么黄、这么脏...,83,33
"I keep blinking at it, waiting for it to go back to blue, or black with stars...whatever time it is.",我继续眨着眼，等待着它变回蓝色，或是有星星的黑色...不论现在是什么时候。,100,37
"I can hear someone next to me, moving around, then I feel something on my hip, someone tugging at my pants.",我能听到有人在我身旁走动，然后，我感觉屁股上有什么东西，有人在拽我的裤子。,107,37
"He's mumbling over me, and I recognize the voice as Jack's, but what is Jack doing...",他在我身上喃喃自语，我听出那是Jack的声音，但是Jack在做什么...,85,36
The mine.,矿井。,9,3
"I reach down to cover up my pocket, trying to ask him what the hell he's doing, but all that comes out is this garbled moan that doesn't sound like me at all.",我伸爪去遮口袋，想问他到底在做什么，但发出来的只有断断续续的呻吟，听起来完全不像我。,158,42
"It takes a second, but I manage to focus on the smaller man leaning over me, one paw fishing around in my pocket while the other holds a shovel.",只有一瞬间，不过我还是设法把注意力集中在了那个，俯在我身上的小个子上。他一只爪子在我的口袋里翻来翻去，另一只拿着铲子。,144,59
"I start to ask again what he's doing, but then his paw yanks out of mine, and he lets out a little laugh that's so loud and high-pitched that it makes me flinch.",我正想继续问他在做什么，不过就在这时，他把爪子从我的爪子里拽了出来。他笑出声音尖利到令我畏缩。,161,47
"I can't see what he's holding, but I hear the clink of coins...and everything comes back to me in a waterfall of confusion, hurt, and most of all, anger.",我看不到他拿着什么，但是我听到了硬币碰撞的叮当声...所有的一切仿佛瀑布般倾泻而下，混合着困惑、受伤，尤其是愤怒。,153,57
"I lunge up and grab at his arm, coming up far too short as a wave of sickening pain shoots through my head and down my back.",我猛地扑起身，抓住他的手臂，却被一阵令人作呕的疼痛阻止了。它从我的头，直刺向我的背部。,124,43
He dodges me easily.,他轻松躲开了我。,20,8
"The man moves away toward his lantern while I stay sat down, putting a paw to the back of my head with a moan.",我跌坐下来，呻吟着用爪子按住后脑勺。与此同时，那个家伙朝他的灯走去。,110,34
"His shadow blocks out the light, and I realize exactly what Jack is doing.",光芒被他的影子所遮盖，我也清楚地意识到了Jack在做什么。,74,29
"He's gonna try to leave me here, lost in the mines while he takes off with my money, everything that I have.",他想把我丢下，迷失在这个矿井中。还有，他抢了我的钱：我所拥有的一切。,108,34
"A snarl works its way out of my throat, and almost without me even thinking about it, I'm pouncing after him, just as he's about to pick up his lantern.",一声怒吼几乎没有经过思考，就从我的喉咙里呼啸而出。就在他要提起灯的时候，我猛扑了过去。,152,43
"My paws smash into his back, right between his shoulder blades.",我的爪子砸在了他的后背上，就在肩胛骨之间。,63,21
"Like he kept mentioning, I'm a hell of a lot bigger than him, and he goes down like a broken matchstick, belly flopping into the dirt.",就像他一直说的那样，我比他大得多。他如同一根折断了的火柴般倒下，肚子陷入泥土中。,134,40
"I hear him lose his breath and before he can do anything else, I slam my fist into the side of his face as hard as I can, four or five times.",我听着他气喘吁吁的呼吸声，在他还来不及做任何事之前，全力打在他的脸上，有四五拳。,141,40
"He hollers after the first, but goes quiet after the third, seizing up under me.",第一拳时，他还在尖叫。第三拳时，他没有了声音和动作。,80,26
"I sit there on top of him, gasping for breath, still wondering what the hell just happened.",我坐在他身上，上气不接下气，仍然在想刚才到底发生了什么。,91,28
"As I stare down at Jack, at his fluttering eyelids and the blood coming out of his mouth, I realize how stupid I am.",我低头看着杰克，看着他颤动的眼皮和嘴里流出的鲜血，意识到了自己是多么的愚蠢。,116,38
So goddamn stupid.,真他妈的蠢。,18,6
"Most people probably would have seen this coming a mile away, but I thought I knew Jack...",大部分人在一英里外就能预见到了，我还以为我了解Jack...,90,30
...at least as much as you can know a person in a week.,...至少在一周内尽可能多地了解了。,55,18
"The thought of so much gold, of living rich...I'd been completely blinded by the thought of it.",这么多的金子，还有富足的生活...我完全被这个想法蒙蔽了双眼。,95,31
"Jack starts to groan louder and move around more, so I reach over for his right paw, forcing it open and grabbing my coins.",Jack的哼声和动作逐渐明显了起来，我掰开他的右爪，夺回了属于自己的硬币。,123,37
"I clutch them protectively to my chest as I stand up, feeling a sudden wave of dizziness as I do.",我将它们紧紧抱胸前，站起身，突然感觉到一阵眩晕。,97,24
"I stumble toward the opening, then rest against it for a moment, catching my breath, waiting for my blurry eyes to focus.",我跌跌撞撞地走向洞口，靠在上面休息了片刻，等待模糊的双眼重新找回焦点。,121,35
"The sharp pain in my head is gone now, replaced by a deep throb that penetrates all the way from the back of my neck to the back of my eyes.",头上的剧痛已经消退，取而代之的是深深的抽痛，从脖子后面一直渗透到了眼睛。,140,36
I reach up to rub at it again and my paw comes away wet and bloody.,我又揉了揉，得到的是湿乎乎、血淋淋的双爪。,67,21
I start to worry that I might be more hurt than I'd thought.,我开始担心自己的伤可能比想象的还要严重。,60,20
"I need to get help, have someone look at it, but first I need to find my way out of this damn mine.",我需要帮助，找人替我看一下。不过首先，我要想办法离开这个倒霉的矿井。,99,34
"I start to push my way through the opening again, but then I remember that I need the lamp.",就在我准备把自己挤进隧道的时候，我想起来我需要那盏灯。,91,27
"I turn around and find Jack already up, moving toward me, just five feet away, this time the pick axe in his paws.",于是我转了回去，发现Jack不知什么时候站了起来，离我只有五英尺远。这一次，他爪子里抓着十字镐。,114,48
"Dully, I wonder if it's the throbbing, rushing sound in my ears that had kept me from hearing him, but I don't have time to think anything else as he rushes at me, thrusting the head of the pick at my face.",我呆滞地想，也许是耳朵里急促的抽动声，导致我能没听见他的动静。但是我没时间思考其他的，他冲了过来，镐的尖头径直凿向我的脸。,206,61
"He doesn't say anything this time, just screams.",他没有说话，只有尖叫。,48,11
"I flinch and raise my paws, but I also let my feet go out from under me, and that's what saves me as I land hard on my rear and I hear the metal hit the hard wall of the cave behind me.",我畏惧地举起爪子，不过救了我一命的却是滑出去的脚。我重重跌坐了下去，金属结实地撞击在身后坚硬的岩壁上。,185,51
"The drop sends a wave of pain through my head that's so bad I gag and almost throw up, but then I see Jack raising the pick above his head, ready to bring it down on me.",这一击在我的头上激起一阵疼痛，痛到我捂住嘴，差点呕吐出来。紧接着，我目视Jack把镐举过头顶，准备要把它砸下来。,169,56
He's gonna kill me.,他要杀了我。,19,6
"Even after what's happened, I find that almost impossible to believe.",即使发生了那样的事，我依然不敢相信这是真的。,69,22
"But there it is in front of me, the man I'd thought was my friend silhouetted by the lamp's dim light, the muscles under his fur bunching up, a snarl of fury on his face.",但这就出现在我的面前，昏暗的灯光勾勒出那个，我曾以为是朋友的家伙的轮廓。他皮毛下的肌肉聚在一起，脸上露出狂怒的表情。,170,58
"I scream, raising my paws to protect myself, coins falling to the ground as the thought of being run through with a pick sends fear through me like I've never known.",我尖叫着，举起爪子保护自己，硬币也随之落下。一想到自己即将被镐头贯穿，前所未有的恐惧穿透了我的全身。,165,50
"As he's raising it, it knocks against the ceiling of the hollow, and Jack starts adjusting the angle of the pick.",Jack举起的搞撞到了洞顶，他因此调整了一下它的角度。,113,27
"I know this is my only chance, and I push myself up off the ground at him, running into him while I grab at his weapon.",我知道，这是我唯一的机会了。我从地上一跃而起，瞄准他的武器扑了过去。,119,34
"He panics and swings too late, the wooden handle landing weakly against my forearms as I reach up and grab it.",他惊慌失措，错过了挥舞的时机，我抬起前臂挡住它无力下落的把手，抓住了它。,110,36
"We both snarl and growl as I pin him to the wall, keeping his weapon above his head with both paws, trying to lift it from his grasp.",我将他压在墙上，试图夺下僵持在他头顶的武器。我们两个人都在咆哮着，怒吼着。,133,37
"He's got a good hold on it though, at least until he takes his right paw away to try and punch at my side.",不过他握得很紧。至少在他松开了右爪，从侧面一拳打过来之前是。,106,30
"I'm so tense from anger and fear that I don't feel anything and with one of his paws gone, I'm able to yank it from him.",因为极度的紧张和愤怒，我什么也感觉不到。而在少了他的一只爪子后，我足以把镐拽过来。,120,41
I stumble back as he drops down.,我摇摇晃晃地退了几步，同时他倒了下去。,32,19

Our eyes meet.,我们目光相接。,14,7

"The sound is deep and sickening, like ice cracking on a frozen river.",声音沉闷而令人作呕，就像结冰的河流开裂那样。,69,22
"When I pull the pickaxe away his expression is completely different, his eyes empty and distant.",我拔出了镐的时候，他的表情已经截然不同，眼神空洞而遥远。,96,28
"He leans there a moment, then his body suddenly spasms and goes ramrod straight before sliding sideways down the wall to lay on his back.",他斜倚在那里，然后没一会儿，他突然开始抽搐，身体挺直，沿着洞壁侧身滑下，仰面躺在地上。,137,43
"I see his paws twitch into fists, pulling up to his chest before he gives this big, heavy sigh.",我看着他双爪握拳，猛地扯到胸前，随之呼出一声沉重的长叹。,95,28
Then he stops breathing altogether.,然后，他完全停止了呼吸。,35,12
"I stare down at him, my chest heaving, the pick hanging loosely in my paw as I wait.",我低头凝视着他，等待着，胸膛剧烈起伏，镐头松垮垮地挂在爪子上。,84,31
"He doesn't move, not at all.",他没有动作，一动也不动。,28,12
"Just from the looks of him, I can tell that he's dead.",从他的样子，我知道他死了。,54,13
"I keep staring, my mind still trying to figure how I got here from just ten minutes ago.",我一直在凝视着他，大脑不断思考自己是怎么在不到十分钟的时间里走到这一步的。,88,37
"But no matter how much I stare, nothing changes in front of me.",但不管我怎么看，面前的一切都不会改变。,63,19
Jack is dead on the ground.,地上的Jack已经死了。,27,12
"I feel a chill run up my spine, and there's this feeling of dread that seems to start pulling up from the Earth into my legs and up into my stomach.",一股寒意涌进我的脊柱，恐惧自地面攀爬到了我的腿上，我的胃里。,148,30
"I don't know why, but I feel like I'm being watched.",不知为何，我有一种被注视着的感觉。,52,17
Like...I just woke something up and it's watching me now.,就好像...我刚吵醒了什么，而它正看着我。,57,21
"I drop the pick and back away from Jack, my nerve failing me, unable to crouch down to check if he really is dead.",我丢下镐往后退，崩溃了的勇气不足以支撑我蹲下，检查他是否真的死了。,114,33
"Despite everything I've been through, I've never seen anyone dead before.",尽管我经历过很多，但从没见过任何人的死亡。,73,21
"Shakily, I turn away from him, looking around.",我颤抖着转过身，看着四周。,46,13
I need to get my money and get the hell out.,我必须找到我的钱，还有离开这个该死的地方。,44,21
If I get caught like this...the men here won't need much more of a reason to hang a whore like me.,如果被这样抓到...这里的男人们就无需更多理由来吊死一个我这样的妓女了。,98,36
I reach out for the lamp that's been sitting on the ground peacefully this whole time.,我伸爪去够始终静坐在地上的灯。,86,15
"I'm still unsteady, still shaky, so when I try to lift up the wire handle, I knock the whole thing over.",我脚步踉跄，无法停止颤抖，以至于我试着提起灯时，将其整个打翻在了地上。,104,35
"Instantly, the flame goes out.",立刻，火焰熄灭了。,30,9
"I stare in shock at the sudden, complete blackness before fumbling for the lantern, as if lifting it up is going to light it again.",我惊愕地看着突然彻底失去了光芒的灯，然后摸索着将它捡起，仿佛这样就能把它重新点亮。,131,41
"Instead, I just touch the heated glass, making me hiss as I burn the pads of my index and middle finger.",然而，我只摸到了滚烫的玻璃。伴随着嘶嘶声，它烫伤了我食指和中指的爪垫。,104,35
The shape of the now-dead flame burned into my vision is the only thing I can see now.,视野中残留着已经熄灭了的火焰的形状，这是我目前唯一能看到的。,86,30

I know straight ahead of me is the opening that leads back into the mine.,我知道，回到矿井的洞口在正前方。,73,16
"Jack had said something about others knowing about this place...maybe I could run into someone, or just find my way out.",Jack说过还有其他人知道这个地方...也许我能遇到什么人，或者直接找到出口。,120,39
"We didn't walk that long, did we?",我们没有走多久，是不是？,33,12

"From there, I paw around until I find the small opening that leads out into the main tunnels.",从那里，我四处摸索着，找到了通往主隧道的洞口。,93,23
"Knowing I dropped the coins here, I go down on my knees and start to feel around for them.",接下来，我双膝跪地，开始四处寻找掉落在这里的硬币。,90,25
"I whisper to myself, to God, to nothing...begging my paws to feel the cool metal.",我喃喃说道，对上帝、对我自己，又或是谁都不对...祈求爪子感受到金属的冰凉。,81,38
"I can't have been searching for more than a minute when something suddenly glides up my spine, like a finger being drawn up my back.",搜索了还不到一分钟。突然，有什么东西顺着我的脊柱滑了上来，就像是一根手指。,132,37
Then breath in my ear.,然后耳边传来了呼吸。,22,10
"I let out an involuntary scream, turning over on my back and scrambling backwards until I come up against the wall, a rod of pain sticking through my brains as I do.",我不由自主地尖叫起来，仰面翻了过去。伴随着如棍子般刺穿了大脑的疼痛，我七手八脚地朝反方向爬去，直到撞在洞壁上。,165,55

"I stumble to my right, in the direction that I know we came from.",我跌跌撞撞地朝右边跑去，朝我所知道的来的方向跑去。,65,25

"It's quiet, whatever it was that was following me isn't anymore...or it's just too far away.",不管跟着我的东西是什么，它很安静...又或者只是太远了。,92,28
"But as I'm listening, I do hear something far back the way I came.",但是在我聆听的时候，我确实听到身后有什么动静，就在和我同一条路线的远方。,66,36
"A stuttered, rhythmic sound, deep and scratchy...I don't know what it is.",断断续续、有节奏的声音，深沉而沙哑...我不知道那是什么。,73,29

"Ahead of me, I see someone walking up the road, a big guy, and it's only then that my stupid head realizes that being seen right now would be very, very bad.",我看到前方有一个人在路上行走着，一个大块头。直到这时，我愚蠢的脑袋才意识到，现在被人看见会非常、非常的糟糕。,157,54

"He pauses again, and I feel that familiar ball of stress and despair flare back up in my stomach.",他欲言又止，熟悉的压力与绝望重新在我胃中绽放。,97,23
"I wait, and while I usually don't mind his silent responses, this is getting me more worried.",我等待着他。通常我并不在意他用沉默来回应，但这次我愈加担心。,93,30
Shit.,该死。,5,3
"I keep my voice steady, rubbing harder, making Nik grunt.",我尽力保持语调平稳，加强了揉捏的力道，令他呻吟了出来。,57,27

"But even as I try to make myself believe that, I know at the same time that that can't be right.",然而，尽管我试图如此相信，但同样清楚，这是不可能的。,96,26

"And while I'm thinking this, I give him the best that my paw can offer, and it seems to have taken his mind off what he was saying completely.",在如此思考的时候，我尽自己一切所能用爪子为他服务，而这似乎这令他完全忘记了说过的话。,142,42
"He's usually content not to have anything below his waist toyed with, but he's bucking right up into my paw.",他通常不要求被我触碰任何腰以下的部位，但现在正在我手中挺进。,108,30
I watch his muscles stand out then relax under his fur each time he does it.,我看着他毛下的肌肉随着他的动作交替着紧绷与放松。,76,24
"His massive hips bounce off the bed, and I actually have to hold on so I don't get bucked to the floor.",他宽大的臀部在床上弹动，而我得牢抓着他才不至于被甩到地上。,103,29
"His powerful body rolls under my work, his bicep tightening under my head, squeezing it for a moment before his paw moves lower to hold me by my back.",在我的服侍下，他震动着强而有力的身躯，绷紧在我头下的二头肌，尔后把手掌移到我背上，以此搂住我。,150,47

"He's leaking and throbbing already, and it makes me wonder if he gets many chances to take care of business himself.",他早已湿了，同时也在抽动；这让我很在意他是否有机会能自己处理。,116,31

"He says my name again, but this time it's more longing, full of lust.",他又喊了我一次，但这次的语气充满欲望与渴求。,69,22
"I start to work him more slowly, my panic settling a bit, thinking again that I'm just being paranoid.",我放慢速度，稍微冷静下来，心想自己只是太神经质了。,102,25
"I'm able to focus a bit more on what I'm doing, and his hot, throbbing length glides smoothly under each tug I give him.",我集中在服侍他上，而他炽热且抽动的肉棒滑顺地擦过我的每下动作。,120,31
Nik's thrusting calms down a bit too so I don't have to worry about falling off the bed.,Nik的抽插也缓和下来，让我不必担心被甩下床。,88,23

"I freeze as that puts me right back into the dark, awful place.",这让我回想起那个地方而僵住。,63,14
"So I pull away, choosing instead to lick at the bushy fur on Nik's chin.",我把头移开，转而舔着他脸颊上的丛毛。,72,18
"He reacts right away, lowering his chin so that we can kiss again.",他马上反应过来，低下脸好让我们接吻。,66,18
"Now I'm really getting into it, because there's not a chance in hell Nik would kiss me if he thought I was a murderer.",我现在才真正进入状况，毕竟Nik没有任何可能会在怀疑我是杀人犯的情况下吻我。,118,38
"On top of that, he'd just let me bite his neck, something lots of people get scared of even if they know you.",更何况，他刚才让我咬他脖子；很多人即使认识你，还是会怕你这样做。,109,32
"Nik lets out a deep, throaty groan that rumbles into my own mouth.",Nik从喉头发出一阵低沉的呻吟，传入我的嘴中。,66,23
"He's close, and now I grin for real.",他快去了，我这才发自内心奸笑。,36,15
"I pull back from the kiss and lean closer to his body, my last downward stroke pushing the skin and fur far down his length, far enough that his balls are pushed near his taint.",我从接吻移开，更加贴近他的躯体；我最后一下的攻势把他的毛皮拉到肉棒的根部，甚至把蛋蛋都推往后庭。,177,48
"Nik arches, his barrel-of-a-body quivering for second, like a little earthquake.",Nik弓起身，他橡木桶般的躯体颤动着，像是地震一样。,80,26

"Then I pull up, and that makes him come hard, his arch somehow getting bigger, lifting his ass and lower back off the bed.",然后我再度把手拉上，让他达到高潮；他弓身的幅度加大，把臀部与下背部抬离床垫。,122,38
"This lifts me too, practically holding onto his cock to keep from sliding off of him, working it hard while ropes of his seed blast out over and over again onto his chest.",我同时也被抬起，只能靠握住他的肉棒才不至于从他身上掉下，这力度也让他一丝丝的白浊喷在他胸膛上。,171,47
"And his muscular hips, stuck in the air, keep thrusting over and over up until the last of his orgasm is done.",他悬空的健壮臀部不断挺进，直到高潮结束。,110,20
"Instead of flopping back to the bed like I expect, he lowers us both gently, letting out a big, great sigh of exhaustion.",最后，跟我想象中会直接倒在床上不同，他温柔地连同我一起降下，因疲累而吐了一口又大又长的气。,121,45
"Teasingly, I pump his cock a couple more times and the giant jumps under me a few times before pulling my paw off.",我恶作剧般地再度撸了好几下，令他在我身下的巨体弹动数次，才被他把我的手拉开。,114,38
Nik stares at me with a mixture of shock and confusion.,Nik以震惊与困惑参半的眼神看着我。,55,18
"I grin at him, and I'm about to ask if I did a good job, but before I can, he's pulling me against his body, kissing me once again.",我回以奸笑，本想问他是否满足我的服务，但却被他拉近，再度给我一吻。,131,33
I straddle Nik's waist which is almost too wide for me to do comfortably.,对我来说Nik的腰身过于宽大了，跨坐在上面不怎么容易。,73,27
"It's comfortable enough though, and I like the feeling of his now-soft cock and balls under my rear.",不过还算舒服，而且我喜欢他软下来的肉棒跟卵蛋在我臀下的触感。,100,30
"I'm leaned forward on his torso, wiping up the fur, taking a little longer than usual because I've never had a client unleash so much cum before.",我俯在他的身体上，擦拭着他的皮毛。这比平时费事些，因为之前没有哪位客户释放出如此的量。,145,43
"Nik even seems surprised, and I can't help but feel a little proud of doing that with just my paw.",甚至Nik本人都好像没有料到，对自己仅靠爪子就能做到这种程度，我不禁有些得意。,98,39
"The badger is quiet for now, staring at the ceiling, his big paws behind his head.",现在的貛一言不发，只是双爪垫在脑后，盯着天花板。,82,24
Nik takes a deep breath before letting it out.,Nik深吸了一口气，然后才回答。,46,16
I shrug.,我耸耸肩。,8,5

"I think, frowning.",我皱起眉头，琢磨了下。,18,11
"That makes me happy, so I keep cleaning him up before reaching for a little bit of dried rosemary that I keep in the bedside drawer.",他的话令我很高兴，于是我更加卖力地清理他的皮毛，之后从床头柜的抽屉里拿出一些干迷迭香。,132,43
"I crush it up, then rub it into his chest fur, hiding the smell of his cum.",我将其弄碎，揉进他胸前的毛中，以盖过精液的味道。,75,24
"It's something that I've seen foxes and otters use to cover up their musk smell, but only the dandy ones.",我见过一些狐狸和水獭藉此掩盖身上的麝香味，但只有花花公子们会这么做。,105,34
"Some customers like to have the smell of sex covered up too, especially if the sex smells like seed, is anywhere but on their crotch, and they're walking out of a whorehouse where the only male whore is.",还有些顾客同样想把性的味道藏起来，尤其是他们除了胯下浑身散发着精液味，并从唯一一个男妓所在的妓院走出来。,203,52
And Nik likes to be extra careful.,而Nik格外谨慎。,34,9

Fuck.,操。,5,2

I tilt my head.,我把头歪向一侧。,15,8
"At the same time, I start to think hard.",与此同时，我开始冥思苦想。,40,13
"I'd be able to overpower any one of my clients, knock 'em out, even kill 'em if I had to.",我的力量足以制服、放倒自己的任何一位客户，甚至杀了他们，如果有这个必要。,89,36
"Probably not William, and definitely not Nik.",William也许不行，而Nik绝无可能。,45,21
I'd only be able to run.,我唯有逃跑一择。,24,8
I numbly realize that my paws have stopped moving.,我麻木地意识到，自己的双爪已经停下了。,50,19
They just rest there on Nik's chest.,它们就这样愣在Nik胸上。,36,13
I can't put words together in my head.,我的大脑无法拼凑出完整的句子。,38,15
"I open my mouth, but I can't speak, even though I try to say something, to pretend I don't know shit, but when nothing comes out, I have to settle for a weak shrug.",我张开嘴，想要说些什么，假装根本不知情。但是我一个字也吐不出来，只能无力地耸了下肩。,164,42
"Nik sighs deeply, his chest rising against my paws, and it's only then that I realize his own massive paws are holding my wrists...gripping my wrists?",Nik深深地叹了口气，胸膛在我爪下起伏。直到这时，我才发现他巨大的双爪正握着我的手腕...抓着我的手腕？,150,52
I'm starting to breathe hard.,我呼吸困难。,29,6
"I start to pull away from the badger, but he doesn't let go.",我意图挣脱貛的爪子，但是他没有松开。,60,18
My voice is dead.,我声如死灰。,17,6

"He only holds on tighter, and when I try to lean back, to kick against the bed to give me leverage, he leans up and I'm instantly pinned by his strength.",他只是攥得更紧了。在我身体后倾，打算借用脚蹬床的反作用力时，他逼近上来，我瞬间被他的力量所制服。,153,48
"I stare like an idiot at the badger, wondering how things changed so quick.",我像个白痴一样注视着这只獾，无法跟上如此迅速的发展。,75,26
"Apparently I'm bad at lying, even though I had thought I'd been keeping up a pretty good ruse this entire time.",看来我不擅长撒谎，竟一直以为自己的诡计天衣无缝。,111,24
"With one question, Nik crushed any resistance I had with the simple, obvious truth that he would have known the second they found Jack.",Nik只用一个问题，用他在Jack被发现的那一刻就推出的，简单明了的真相，便将我所有的抵抗击碎。,135,48
I didn't even put up a fight.,我甚至无法反驳。,29,8

"While it doesn't surprise me, I'd been sheltered by the palace since I got here, as much as it could be called a shelter, anyway.",虽然我不该感到惊讶。自从来到这里，我就一直住在皇宫。换而言之，我的庇护所。,129,37

Brunis looks back at me.,Brunis回头看向我。,24,12

Brunis laughs.,Brunis笑了。,14,9
Neferu waves a paw lazily in Brunis's general direction.,Neferu懒洋洋地朝Brunis的方向挥了挥爪子。,56,26
The conversation's sudden turn from friendly to tense is a bit jarring.,谈话突然从友好转为了紧张，有点不和谐。,71,19
"It's clearly about a lot more than Brunis's \""delicacy\"", and I wonder if this was already a point of contention between them.",其内容显然远远超出了Brunis的‘小心谨慎’，我想知道这是否成为了他们的争论点。,126,41
Brunis is quiet for a moment.,Brunis沉默了好一会。,29,13
I kind of wish we'd just gone to a tailor.,我真的希望我们能找个裁缝了。,42,14
Being inside someplace warm while being fussed over by another wolf is preferable to being alone with these two bickering Khemians.,在温暖的地方被一只狼纠缠，总好过跟这两个剑拔弩张的克米扬独处。,131,31
The silence really drags on now as we turn onto a street that's as empty as the last.,我们默不作声地拐进另一条同样空旷的街道。,85,20
"I occasionally catch the sight of wolves peering from windows or balconies, but they quickly disappear as soon as I look up.",偶尔能看到有狼从窗户或阳台上窥视，但只要我一抬头，他们便迅速消失了。,124,34

"Now that I'm focusing more on those scars and prosthetic arm, I'm suddenly realizing who this might be, and where he might come from.",我把注意力放在了那些疤和假肢上，猛地意识到他可能是谁，可能来自哪里。,133,34

"I can count, on one hand, the number of times I've seen it happen.",类似的情况用一只手都能数得过来。,66,16
"I feel bad for Neferu, but he did provoke this argument, and I guess Khemians are supposed to be blunt.",我为Neferu感到难过，但也是他挑起了这场争论。克米扬确实很直言不讳。,103,36
I see Neferu's ears lower even more.,我看到Neferu的耳朵压得更低了。,36,18
"After a few seconds, I see Neferu bring his expression into a more neutral state, though I see his eyes flick toward me for just a moment, probably wishing just as much as I do that I wasn't here.",过了几秒钟，Neferu的表情缓和了下来。尽管我留意到他朝我瞥了一眼，可能是和我一样希望我没在场吧。,196,50
"Sure enough, wolven heads have reappeared at windows and balcony ledges, many of them staring wide-eyed at all three of us.",果然，窗口和阳台上又冒出了沃尔文的脑袋，其中不少人盯着我们三个，眼睛睁得大大的。,123,40

We seem to finally reach the wolverine's flat as we walk around to the back of a two-story building and towards a door that seems to lead down into a basement.,似乎终于抵达了狼獾的公寓。我们走到一栋双层楼的后面，朝着一扇通向地下室的门走去。,159,40
"We don't even enter the building as he rummages around in some metal crates right at the entrance before activating black, dome-shaped drones that float above us.",我们都没有进到楼中。他在入口处的金属箱里翻找了一番，然后激活了黑色、圆顶状的无人机，悬浮在我们头顶。,162,50

I watch Neferu as he seems to squirm in delight at the feeling of his own drone's warmth.,我看向Neferu，他似乎沉浸在无人机的温暖中，忘乎所以。,89,29
They both laugh.,他们一起笑了。,16,7

"By any other standard, it would have been a fine speech, something he himself would have been proud of if he'd been the one to give it.",不管以什么标准来看，那都是一场精彩的演讲。如果演讲人是他的话，他也为此感到骄傲的。,135,41
"For Cassius, though, it was subpar at best.",虽然对Cassius而言，这连一般水准都达不到。,43,24
"He'd certainly said what was needed to be said, but his usual fire and passion had been absent.",他自然说了该说的话，却不见了平日里的热情与激情。,95,24
"While there are no large crowds due to the curfew, it was obvious the Luxians were aware of how lacking the speech had been.",拜宵禁所赐，现场人不多，但卢克斯的人民明显察觉到了这场演讲有多不足。,124,34
"Even now, the triumvirs appear slightly perturbed, and Amicus closes his eyes in quiet frustration as he imagines the thousands of citizens listening to the speech in their homes.",到了现在，就连三人执政团好像都在惴惴不安。Amicus想象着千家万户收听演讲的画面，在沮丧中闭上了双眼。,179,52
"Still, Amicus knows that he won't be scolding his brother after all is said and done.",尽管如此，Amicus明白，自己终究不会责怪弟弟的行为。,85,28
"Cass had not been himself since his poisoning, and Amicus had suspected that what would be his first speech since that incident would not go well.",Cass中毒后就一直不在状态，Amicus也怀疑自事件以来，他的首次演讲能否顺利进行。,146,43
Amicus also imagines that Cassius having to verbally pledge his support to him only made it more difficult for his younger brother.,Amicus还觉得，Cassius不得不口头承诺支持他，这只会让他弟弟的日子更难过。,131,42
"But now, the exhibition match is already upon him, and because of that uninspiring speech, Amicus realizes that he must lose this match if he's to quell the City of Rebellion's fury.",但眼下，表演赛已经开始了。Amicus心里清楚，由于那篇乏味的演讲，为了平息叛逆之城的怒火，他必须输掉这场比赛。,182,56

"The old wolf, who had been smiling pleasantly off to the side for the duration of the introductory speeches, moves rather smoothly, and Amicus notes his unusual focus on kicks.",开幕期间，老狼始终面带微笑、动作自信而流畅，Amicus也能注意到他对踢腿非一般的投入。,176,44
"It's not anything Amicus hasn't come up against in his past matches, and he has little doubt he can easily crush the old man if he caught him in a grapple.",Amicus在过去的比赛中未曾遭遇敌手，如果能找准时机抓住老狼，他有十足的把握轻松击败对方。,155,46
"But that wolf is a hero, a champion in these lands.",但那只狼是这片土地的冠军，一位英雄。,51,18
"Amicus knows that the consequences of beating him in front of his own people might very well lead to a sudden, unlawful end to the curfew, followed by a riot that would endanger the entire delegation.",Amicus知道在人民面前惨败他的后果：宵禁可能会突然结束，随之而来的是危及整个代表团的暴乱。,200,47

"While he would have preferred that his human not see this match, it still fills him with a burst of energy, intending to show him how physically capable he is.",虽然不希望这场比赛被人类看到，但这仍令他充满了动力，他有意展示起自己的身体素质。,159,40
"Indeed, Amicus had shown him that plenty of times during their own physical encounters in the bedroom, but that required considerable restraint on his part.",事实上，Amicus已经在私底下的身体接触中展示过许多次了，但那需要他相当的克制。,156,41
"As Amicus straightens up, breathing evenly, the older wolf disrobes and finally steps forward to greet his emperor.",Amicus直起身子，均匀地呼吸着，老狼也终于脱下衣服，走上前去迎接自己的皇帝。,115,40
"Amicus already knows him to be Magistr, the unusual name having been given to him later in life, indicative of his status amongst the people of Lux.",Magistr，这个不同寻常的名字是他晚年时被赋予的，这代表了他在卢克斯人民心目中的地位，Amicus也有所耳闻。,148,57
"Amicus nods his head as the old wolf bows low to the ground, sensing only a genuine feeling of goodwill from the other wolf.",老狼俯身鞠躬，Amicus感受着另一只狼对他的善意，点点头。,124,30
Magis answers by falling into an odd stance that seems to emphasize striking over grappling as Amicus squats low toward the ground.,作为回答，Magis摆出了一种奇怪的姿势。与蹲在地上的Amicus不同，对方突出的不是擒拿，而是打击。,131,51
"Their styles seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum in {i}pugnu{/i} techniques, but Amicus has dealt with such fighting styles in the past, especially from Cato.",他们的{b}Pugnu{/b}风格似乎截然相反，但Amicus也有应对的经验，尤其是从Cato那。,166,49
He doubts this wolf is able to match that warrior's speed and strength.,他不认为这只狼的速度与力量能与那名战士匹敌。,71,22
"Deciding to make the first move, Amicus rushes in for a tackle, knowing that a takedown would instantly turn the fight in his favor.",Amicus决定先发制人，他冲过去一个擒抱，试图通过摔倒对手让自己占据上风。,132,38
"While he still plans to throw the match, he needs to make it look good.",虽然他无意取得胜利，但场面一定要精彩。,71,19
"[mc] is watching, after all, and maybe his powerful charge will let the old wolf know that his impending win is artificial.",毕竟[mc]也在看，也许一记强有力的冲锋能教会老狼他即将获得的胜利是被人拱手相送的。,123,42
"His muscles propel his bulk forward, and in the back of his mind, Amicus just slightly worries that he might accidentally end the match by crushing the old wolf.",他的身体在肌肉的推动下不断向前逼近，只是Amicus暗自担心，他可能会压伤这只老狼，从而意外取得胜利。,161,51
"His rush is brought to an instant and jarring halt, the jolt emanating through his core before spreading out to his limbs, making him almost fold in half in midair.",冲锋戛然而止，强烈的震动穿透他的躯干波动到四肢，他几乎在半空中对折成了两半。,164,38
"Pressure builds in his chest, then into his cheeks which almost humorously swell up before his breath blasts from his muzzle so hard and fast that it makes his lips ripple.",压力积聚在他的胸腔，接着被挤到面颊。那一瞬间，他的脸以一种滑稽的方式膨胀起来，猛烈而急促的气流从他的口鼻中爆发，震得他的嘴唇都泛起波纹。,172,68
"It only lasts a few seconds, but Amicus is at least able to understand that he'd been viciously kicked in the stomach.",这只持续了短短几秒，但Amicus最起码能够知道自己被狠狠踢了一脚。,118,34
"So hard, in fact, that Magis's foot had very nearly disappeared into his belly.",这一击如此有力，以至于Magis的脚几乎埋在了他的肚子中。,79,29
"Somehow, his opponent doesn't budge in the least bit as he holds steady against Amicus's much larger bulk, and finally the younger wolf comes back down to land on weak ankles.",不知为何，Amicus的对手稳稳顶住了他庞大得多的身体，丝毫不为所动。最后，年轻的狼双腿无力，朝地面跌去。,175,53
"Amicus then folds up on the floor of the amphitheater, deafening silence ringing in his ears as he heaves several times, wondering how he'd been affected so badly despite being tensed and ready.",随后Amicus瘫倒在了竞技场的地板上，呕吐不止，耳边回荡着震耳欲聋的寂静。他是很紧张，但也做好了准备，他不明白自己为何会受到这么严重的影响。,194,71
"He manages to keep calm, waiting for his breathing to return to normal, having experienced similar situations during his sparring matches with his father, and then with Cato.",他勉强保持着冷静，等待呼吸恢复正常。他在与父亲或Cato的对打训练中也经历过类似的情况。,174,44
"In fact, not since Cato has he felt such breathless agony, but even he had never managed to land such a blow when Amicus had been prepared.",事实上，自Cato之后，他就再也没有感受过如此令人窒息的痛苦。但即便是Cato，也从来无法在Amicus有所准备的情况下打出这样一击。,139,67
"The wolf tries not to look toward his delegation, pushing the knowledge from his mind that his human is watching.",狼尽量不去在意他的代表团，努力把人类正在看的事实从脑中抹去。,113,30
"Finally, he begins to breathe normally, and manages to pull himself back up to his feet, trying to muster back up his will to fight after having it knocked from him.",终于，他取回了呼吸，并设法站起来，试图在被击倒后鼓起斗志。,165,29
"The older wolf had been slowly moving back and forth in a half-circle in front of Amicus, making himself look busy, clearly avoiding a possible grappling situation.",老狼在Amicus面前来来回回绕着半圈，让自己看起来不那么闲，显然是在避免可能发生的扭打。,164,45
"The humiliation of the first blow warms Amicus's cheeks and ears, its memory leaving his belly feeling hollowed out.",第一击的屈辱令Amicus的脸和耳朵直发烫，他的肠子都悔青了。,116,31
"Maybe throwing the match isn't the best idea, not after being downed with such ease, and knowing this is being broadcasted to all of Adastra.",也许还是不放弃为好，尤其是被对手轻松击倒以后，要知道这场比赛正在向全阿达斯特拉直播。,141,42
"Amicus sets his expression into an iron mask of stoic readiness, this time waiting for the old wolf to come to him.",Amicus摆出一副坚忍的扑克脸，这一次，他决定等老狼先手。,115,30
"Magis does so slowly, and the second he's within reach, his foot flies up again.",Magis行动缓慢，可一旦得手，他的脚又瞬间腾空而起。,80,27
Time slows for Amicus as his eyes flick to the sudden movement.,在Amicus快速转动的眼球中，时间慢了下来。,63,23
"The wolf knows he's not in the best shape, his training time having been completely swallowed up by imperial duties.",狼知道现在的自己并非最佳状态，他的训练时间已经被皇帝的职责完全挤占了。,116,35
"Still, some skills never left one's mind after learning them.",然而，有些东西学过就永远不会忘记。,61,17
He's reminded of this as muscle memory kicks in to catch the lighting-quick attack.,当肌肉记忆发挥作用，用以捕捉闪电般的快速攻势时，他回忆了起来。,83,31
"Instinct takes full control, and Amicus begins to prepare his next attack, one which will bring the fight to the ground where he knows he'll have a significant advantage.",本能接管了他的身体，Amicus开始筹备下一次进攻，这将把战场转移向地面，在那里他有显著优势。,170,47
"The man can kick, that's for certain, but even now, Amicus can feel his own muscles and strength overcoming anything the older wolf tries to bring against him.",老狼当然可以踢腿，可到了现在，Amicus同样能感觉自己的肌肉和力量足以碾压对手。,159,41
His foot is stuck and he isn't getting it free unless Amicus lets him.,他的腿被卡住了，除非Amicus允许，否则他将无法脱身。,70,28
"The younger wolf spots the one foot the other wolf is balanced on, preparing to sweep it from under--",年轻的狼把目标瞄向了老狼用来平衡的另一条腿，刚准备从下方扫过-,101,31
"Time slows once more, but this time Amicus can't do much as the older wolf uses the support Amicus is giving him and swings up the other foot.",时间又变慢了，但这一次Amicus无计可施。老狼通过Amicus作支点，单脚发力跳到半空。,142,45
Both of Amicus's paws are occupied.,Amicus的两只爪子都被占用了。,35,17
He can only watch as the foot sails his way.,他只能眼睁睁看着那只脚朝自己的方向袭来。,44,20
Amicus has just enough time to realize it's over when--,他眼前闪过一道白光，那只脚以迅雷不及掩耳之势猛地踢进了他的鼻子，可一点也不疼。,55,39
"Amicus's vision flashes white, the foot whipping into his muzzle so hard and fast that it doesn't hurt at all.",因为Amicus才反应过来，一切都结束了。,110,21
"Instead, a numbing feeling is left behind as the younger wolf is stunned.",因为他被踢得昏昏沉沉，全身上下仅有麻木。,73,20
"Time is still slow, dragging out his defeat longer than he'd like.",时间依旧过得很慢，把他的失败拖得比他希望的还要久。,66,25
"He has a moment to see his crown flash in the dull sunlight, Amicus deciding that it's rather appropriate for how badly he'd been beaten.",有那么一刻，他瞥到自己的皇冠在暗淡的阳光下闪闪发光，他认为这正是自己惨败的最好写照。,137,42
"Again, Amicus is hit with not just a wave of pain, but one of familiarity.",再一次地，Amicus受到的打击不只疼痛，还有一种熟悉的感觉。,74,31
"The feeling of confusion, followed by squinting at the sky.",困惑。他眯起眼睛，注视着天空。,59,15
"It had been a good while since he'd been knocked unconscious, and he doesn't miss the feeling.",他已经有段时间没有被打得不省人事了，他不会怀念这种感觉的。,94,29
"He does savor it for a moment, though, having enough sense to know that something humiliating is waiting for him on the other side of consciousness.",不过，他确实享受了片刻。毕竟残存的理智足够告诉他，什么样的羞辱在等待着他的清醒。,148,40
"Seeing Magis, Amicus is reminded of what happened, and he groans internally.",看到Magis，Amicus想起发生了什么，内心一阵呻吟。,76,29
It hadn't been a terribly embarrassing fight.,这场搏斗并没有那么尴尬。,45,12
"It lasted about as long as an average match, though the kick at the beginning was certainly something that would be hard to live down.",它的时长和一般比赛相近，尽管最开始的那脚注定令人难忘。,134,27
"It would likely be replayed on the news channels over and over, similar to Neferu's clash with Cato.",它多半会在新闻频道上反复播放，就像Neferu和Cato的冲突一样。,100,34
"Sure, he could ban it, but that would only confirm him to be as humiliated as he feels right now.",当然，他可以选择禁播，但这只会让他感到耻辱，正如现在。,97,27

That's important now that he is sure to become a part of their delegation.,这很重要，因为他无疑将成为代表团的一员。,74,20
"But again, rather than sensing any malicious intent to further humiliate the younger wolf, Amicus only senses genuine feelings of respect.",但是，Amicus并没有感觉他有任何进一步羞辱自己的恶意，而是真正的尊重。,138,37
"Quickly, the Emperor rights himself, taking his crown from the other man.",很快，皇帝恢复了意识，从另一个人手中接过皇冠。,73,23
"Amicus tries to smile through the after-match pleasantries, finally sparing a glance toward [mc].",在赛后的寒暄中，Amicus直到最后才偷瞄了[mc]一眼。,97,29
"His expression is hard to read, but when he catches Amicus's eye, he gives him a smile.",他的表情很难形容，不过与Amicus的目光相遇时，他对Amicus微微笑了下。,87,39
"It's tight, and concerned, but it still surprises the young wolf.",笑得很僵硬，难掩其中的担心，但仍出乎狼的意料。,65,23
"It's as if he's trying to let Amicus know that it's okay he lost, that he's only concerned for his wellbeing.",就好像他试图让Amicus明白，就算输了也没关系，他只关心他的健康。,109,34

I can tell that he's embarrassed right now.,我看得出他现在有多尴尬。,43,12

"I know him well enough to keep my concern and affections in check for now, instead letting everyone play it off like nothing happened.",出于对他的了解，我暂时克制住自己的关心和感情，让大家假装什么都没发生。,134,35
"The others follow me, introducing themselves one by one to the older wolf.",其他人跟在我后面，一个接一个地向老狼介绍自己。,74,23
"While Virginia had watched the entirety of the fight with hardly any expression, I was a bit surprised to see Cassius lower his eyes when it became clear Amicus was losing.",Virginia几乎面无表情地看完了整场比赛。而让我惊讶的是，当Amicus的失败已成定局时，Cassius垂下了目光。,172,60
"I assumed he might take pleasure in seeing his emperor brother get trounced, but he just seems to have been made uncomfortable by the whole thing.",我还以为他乐于看到自己的皇兄被打败，然而他好像被整件事弄得很不舒服。,146,34
"Meanwhile, Neferu had watched with an expression that seemed on the verge of disgust while Brunis visibly cringed and shook his head throughout.",与此同时，Neferu始终面露近乎厌恶的表情，Brunis则明显被吓到了，整场比赛都在摇头。,144,46
"As for me, I just feel a relieved weakness flooding through my limbs after the surge of adrenaline during the fight.",至于我，在经历过肾上腺素狂飙后，我只觉得四肢瘫软，如释重负。,116,30
"It was a feeling of dread and terror that I had felt a few times, specifically when seeing Amicus and Cato fight.",我有过几次这种惧怕的感觉，尤其是在看到Amicus和Cato的生死之战时。,113,37
It makes me wonder if I can ever watch another {i}pugnu{/i} match again.,我不禁怀疑，自己还能否接受多一场{b}Pugnu{/b}比赛。,72,31
"Amicus places his heavy paw around my shoulders, grunting slightly as he pulls me into his side and fixes a tight smile on his face.",Amicus把沉重的爪子搭在我的肩膀上，轻声咕哝着把我拉到他身边，同时脸上挂着紧绷的微笑。,132,45
Amicus shrugs his shoulders quickly.,Amicus微微耸了耸肩。,36,13
"Magis smiles pleasantly, and despite his brutality in {i}pugnu{/i} reminding me of Cato, he doesn't seem anything like that old wolf.",Magis和蔼地微笑着。尽管他在{b}Pugnu{/b}中的无情令我想起了Cato，但二者一点也不像。,133,51
"Amicus nods his head at Magis, and I take that as my cue to bow to the old wolf.",Amicus向Magis点头致意，我也借机向老狼鞠躬。,80,27
He responds by making sure to bow lower than me.,作为回应，他鞠躬的姿势比我低。,48,15
"With that, the formalities seem to end, and I feel Amicus steer me toward one of the exits to the city square.",就这样，他们终于走完了程序，我被Amicus带到了城市广场的一个出口。,110,35

The cold gray walls give way almost instantly to the rolling hills and jagged mountains of the tundra beyond.,冰冷的灰色墙壁几乎立刻被坐落于苔原上连绵起伏的山丘和参差不齐的山脉所取代。,109,37
